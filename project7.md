The tools we want to use are well known and widely used by multiple DevOps teams, so we will introduce a single DevOps Tooling Solution that will consist of:

1. Jenkins – free and open source automation server used to build CI/CD pipelines.
2. Kubernetes – an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.
3. Jfrog Artifactory – Universal Repository Manager supporting all major packaging formats, build tools and CI servers. Artifactory.
4. Rancher – an open source software platform that enables organizations to run and manage Docker and Kubernetes in production.
5. Grafana – a multi-platform open source analytics and interactive visualization web application.
6. Prometheus – An open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, flexible query language, efficient time series database and modern alerting approach.
7. Kibana – Kibana is a free and open user interface that lets you visualize your Elasticsearch data and navigate the Elastic Stack.
