## TOOLING WEBSITE DEPLOYMENT AUTOMATION WITH CONTINUOUS INTEGRATION. INTRODUCTION TO JENKINS

[CI](https://circleci.com/continuous-integration/)

- In this project we are going to start automating part of our routine tasks with a free and open source automation server â€“ Jenkins. It is one of the mostl popular CI/CD tools, it was created by a former Sun Microsystems developer Kohsuke Kawaguchi and the project originally had a named "Hudson".
- Acording to Circle CI, Continuous integration (CI) is a software development strategy that increases the speed of development while ensuring the quality of the code that teams deploy.

> Task
- Enhance the architecture prepared in Project 8 by adding a Jenkins server, configure a job to automatically deploy source codes changes from Git to NFS server.

Here is how your updated architecture will look like upon competion of this project:

### Install and Configure Jenkins server

> Step 1 - Install Jenkins Server
1. Create an AWS EC2 server based on Ubuntu server 20.04 LTS and name it "Jenkins" with TCP port 8080 open in the inbound rule
2. Install[JDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit)
   ```
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install default-jdk-headless

   ```
3. Install Jenkins
    ```
        wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
        sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install jenkins
    ```
4. Verify jenkins is up and runningh
    ```
        sudo systemctl status jenkins
    ```

    * Retrieve the adminstrator password from your server: sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

      ![](images/project9/admin-password.png)

    * Enter the password in the administrator page above and click continue
