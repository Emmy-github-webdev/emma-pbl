# DEPLOYING APPLICATIONS INTO KUBERNETES CLUSTER

Within this project we are going to learn and see in action following:

<br>

1. Deployment of software applications using [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) manifest files with following K8s objects:
- Pods
- ReplicaSets
- Deployments
- StatefulSets
- Services (ClusterIP, NodeIP, Loadbalancer)
- Configmaps
- Volumes
- PersistentVolumes
- PersistentVolumeClaims

2. Difference between stateful and stateless applications
- Deploy MySQL as a StatefulSet and explain why

3. Limitations of using manifests directly to deploy on K8s
- Working with [Helm](https://helm.sh/) templates, its components and the most important parts â€“ semantic versioning
- Converting all the _.yaml_ templates into a helm chart

4. Deploying more tools with Helm charts on AWS Elastic [Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)

* Jenkins
  - MySQL
  - Ingress Controllers (Nginx)
* Cert-Manager
* Ingress for Jenkins
* Ingress for the actual application

5. Deploy Monitoring Tools
- Prometheus
- Grafana
6. Hybrid CI/CD by combining different tools such as: [Gitlab CICD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), Jenkins. And, you will also be introduced to concepts around [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) using [Weaveworks Flux](https://www.weave.works/oss/flux/).
