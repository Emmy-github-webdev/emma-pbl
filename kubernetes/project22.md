# DEPLOYING APPLICATIONS INTO KUBERNETES CLUSTER

Within this project we are going to learn and see in action following:

<br>

1. Deployment of software applications using [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) manifest files with following K8s objects:
- Pods
- ReplicaSets
- Deployments
- StatefulSets
- Services (ClusterIP, NodeIP, Loadbalancer)
- Configmaps
- Volumes
- PersistentVolumes
- PersistentVolumeClaims

2. Difference between stateful and stateless applications
- Deploy MySQL as a StatefulSet and explain why

3. Limitations of using manifests directly to deploy on K8s
- Working with [Helm](https://helm.sh/) templates, its components and the most important parts â€“ semantic versioning
- Converting all the _.yaml_ templates into a helm chart

4. Deploying more tools with Helm charts on AWS Elastic [Kubernetes Service (EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/)

* Jenkins
  - MySQL
  - Ingress Controllers (Nginx)
* Cert-Manager
* Ingress for Jenkins
* Ingress for the actual application

5. Deploy Monitoring Tools
- Prometheus
- Grafana
6. Hybrid CI/CD by combining different tools such as: [Gitlab CICD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/), Jenkins. And, you will also be introduced to concepts around [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) using [Weaveworks Flux](https://www.weave.works/oss/flux/).

### Choosing the right Kubernetes cluster set up

When it comes to using a Kubernetes cluster, there is a number of options available depending on the ultimate use of it. For example, if you just need a cluster for development or learning, you can use lightweight tools like [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.kubernetes.io/docs/start/), or [k3s](https://k3s.io/). These tools can run on your workstation without heavy system requirements. Obviously, there is limit to the amount of workload you can deploy there for testing purposes, but it works exactly like any other Kubernetes cluster.

<br>

On the other hand, if you need something more robust, suitable for a production workload and with more advanced capabilities such as horizontal scaling of the worker nodes, then you can consider building own Kubernetes cluster from scratch just as you did in [Project 21](https://expert-pbl.darey.io/en/latest/project21.html). If you have been able to automate the entire bootstrap using Ansible, you can easily spin up your nodes with Terraform, and configure the cluster with your Ansible configuration scripts.

<br>

It it a great combination of tools responsible for different parts of your applications:
- **Terraform** for infrastructure provisioning
- **Ansible** for cluster master and worker nodes configuration
- **Kubernetes** for deploying your containerized application and orchestrating the deployment

Other options will be to leverage a [Managed Service](https://www.adept.co.uk/the-benefits-of-cloud-managed-services-for-business/) Kubernetes cluster from public cloud providers such as: [AWS EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/), [Microsoft AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/kubernetes-service), or Google Cloud Platform GKE. There are so many more options out there. Regardless of whichever one you choose, the experience is usually very similar.

Most organisations choose Managed Service options for obvious reasons such as:

Less administrative overheads
Reduced cost of ownership
Improved Security
Seamless support
Periodical updates to a stable and well-tested version
Faster cluster spin up
